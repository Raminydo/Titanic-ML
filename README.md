# Titanic_ML

This repository contains data analysis and data visualization of Titanic dataset on one seprated notebook. The following notebooks are related to implementing one machine learning algorithm for binary classification as if each person in dataset has survived or not.
The goal is to observe various methods for binary classification and compare their results. This will lead to further approaches which is data mining and extracting useful information about the dataset.
